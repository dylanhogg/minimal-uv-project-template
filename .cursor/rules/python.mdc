## Core Python Libraries to Use

- Use `typer` for building CLI applications
- Use `loguru` for all logging needs
- Use `pydantic` for data models and validation
- Use `python-dotenv` for environment variable management
- Use `ruff` for code formatting
- Use `pytest` for unit and integration tests

## Preferred Python Libraries, to install and use when Appropriate

- Use `pandas` for data processing
- Use `numpy` for scientific computing
- Use `fastapi` for REST API endpoints
- Use `litellm` as an LLM wrapper
- Use `uvicorn` as an ASGI web server (and `uvloop` if approprite)
- Use `joblib` for lightweight pipelining & caching
- Use `pytorch` for machine learning
- Use `transformers` for nlp, llms, and models
- Use `datasets` for ready-to-use datasets for AI models
- Use `jupyterlab` or `marimo` for notebooks
- Use `streamlit` or `gradio` for demo apps
- Use `tenacity` for retrying function calls
- Use `rich` for formatting terminal output
- Use `pyarrow` for data serialization
- Use `arrow` for date and time conversions
- Use `requests` or `httpx` for HTTP communications

## Other Python Libraries to Consider

- Fall back to `scikit-learn` for machine learning if pytorch cannot be used
- Consider `joblib.Memory` for complex caching when `@functools.cache` is insufficient
- Consider `joblib.Parallel` for concurrency when appropriate
- Use `sqlalchemy` for SQL ORM when appropriate

## Python Coding Guidelines

- Always be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
- Keep sensitive information in `.env` files
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document all configuration options
- Do not over-engineer solutions - strive for simplicity and maintainability while being efficient
- Keep docstrings minimal, prefer the code to speak for itself
- Leverage `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to maximize concurrency
- Leverage `asyncio` as an event-loop framework when appropriate
- Apply decorator `@functools.cache` function caching where appropriate
- For any pandas data pipelines, prefer chainable functions with `DataFrame.pipe(func, ...)`
- Use f-strings for string formatting, and prefer the f"{var=}" syntax to show the variable name and its value

## Tests

- Follow the naming convention: test_*.py
- Use fixtures for test setup and teardown

## Project Structure

- Keep source code in a `src` directory
- Place tests in a `tests` directory
- Keep configuration files in the root directory
- Manage dependencies via `pyproject.toml`
- Package management is via `uv`
